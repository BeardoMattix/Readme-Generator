## Description
This is a command line application that allows developers to quickly and easily create a professional readme.md file from the command line.
 
## Technologies
JavaScrips, Node.js

## Functionality
Once initiallized, this app prompts the user with a series of questions about their project. Once all questions have been answered, the app creates a readme.md file. 

## Demo
no

## Challenges
undefined

## Usage
This app should be used to create readme files from the command line. It can also be used as a way to understand how to write files based on promts and answers. 

## Test
To test this application, download the source code and run it in node.js.

## Installation
This app is initiallized through node. The user downloads the source code and then runs "npm i" to install all dependencies (inquirer). Then run in node by typing "node index.js" in the command line. 

## Contributors

## Future Development
In the future I would like to include API calls to dynamically generate more content.
