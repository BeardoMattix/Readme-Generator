## Description
This readme was generated using the Readme Generator Application I built with Node.js
 
## Technologies
JavaScript and Node.js

## Functionality
The program uses the npm 'Iquirer' package. It asks users questions and generates a readme file based on the responses. The Readme file is pre-formatted, so the user will always have a consistent readme for their repo.

## Demo
![badge](This is where the user can quickly add demo gifs and screenshots to their readme. )

## Challenges
The license section was the trickiest part of building this application. 

## Usage
Use this application to create a professional readme file from the command line!

## Test
N/A

## Installation
This app is installed by running 'npm init' followed by 'npm i' to install the dependencies. Once all dependencies are installed, run 'node index.js' in the command line to use the application. 

## Contributors
undefined

## Future Development
In the future I would like to create more application in node that create shortcuts for developers. This project is a good introduction to the back-end and how to use libraries.
